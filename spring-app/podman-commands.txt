podman image build -t <image-name>:<tag> .
podman login docker.io
podman push <imageID> docker://<namespace>/<repo>

#Run container
podman run --publish <host_port>:<container_port> <container-name>

#Note: It's very important to know what the underlying architecture of the host machine.
If the image you want to run is not on a compatiable architecture it will fail:

For example:
Mac is arm64 whereas most other machines run on x86_64/amd64. This is something that can either be specified
during a build or in the Dockerfile/Containerfile itself.

Here's an example of the command you can run:
podman image build --platform="linux/amd64" -t test .
